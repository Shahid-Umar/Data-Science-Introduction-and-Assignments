> ### *Types of AI*
1. Artificial Narrow Intelligence:  AI designed to complete concrete actions; unable to independently learn.
2.  Artificial General Intelligence:  AI designed to learn, think, and perform at similar levels to humans.
3.   Artificial Superintelligence:  AI surpasses humans' knowledge and capabilities.
4.   Reactive Machines:  AI capable of responding to external stimuli in real time; unable to build memory or store information for future.
5.   Limited Memory:  AI that can store and use knowledge to learn and train for future tasks.
6.   Theory of Mind:  AI that can sense and respond to human emotions, plus perform the tasks of limited memory machines.
7.   Self-awareness:  AI that can recognize othersâ€™ emotions, plus has sense of self and human-level intelligence; the final stage of AI.

> ### *Data Science vs Data Analysis*
> ### *Data Scientist vs Data Analyst*
1. *DataScience vs DataAnalytics:*
Both fields involve working with data to gain insights, **'data science'** often involves using data to build models that can predict future outcomes, while **'data analytics'** tends to focus more on analyzing past data to inform decisions in the present and for the future.

1. *DataScientist vs DataAnalyst:*
Data Analyst and Data Scientist are two career paths in big data.
The basic difference between the two is that a **'data scientist'** works to capture data while a **'data analyst'** tries to gain insights from that data.

1. ***Python Indent:*** When you type a line of code and Enter, it will provide you with the correct Python indentation.
2. ***DVC Extension:*** Every data team depends on it to version the dataset for reproducibility purposes. DVC extension makes large file versioning simpler and easier.
3. ***Excel Viewer:*** Excel Viewer is a simple VS Code extension that previews Excel and CSV files on the IDE.
4. ***Data Wrangler:*** Data Wrangler can be used on any comma seperated value (.csv) data file or on any Pandas data frame in a Jupyter notebook.
5. ***SandDance for VSCode:*** Interactive data analysis tool for previewing data files to Visual Studio Code this extension can be used on any comma or tab separated value (.csv or .tsv) data file,
