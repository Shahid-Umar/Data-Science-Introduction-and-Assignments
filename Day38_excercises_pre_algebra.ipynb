    "5. You have a rope 30 meters long, and you need to cut it into pieces that are 2.5 meters each. How many pieces can you cut?\n",
    "   - `Rope Total length (L) = 30, Single Piece Length (S) = 2.5, No of Rope Pieces = Rp`\n",
    "   - `Now we have expression 2.5 * Rp = 30 ==> Rp = 30/2.5 = 12`\n",

    "6. Mike read twice as many books this year as last year. If he read 5 books last year, how many books did he read this year?\n",
    "   - `Suppose we consider this year read is x`\n",
    "   - `As per above statement x = 2 * last year read`\n",
    "   - `x = 2 * 4 = 8 books read this year`\n",
    "7. If a car travels 150 kilometers in 2 hours, what is its average speed?\n",
    "   - `Average speed of car (M) = Total Distance / Total Time`\n",
    "   - `M = 150/2 = 75 kilometer`\n",
    "8. Solve for x in the equation 5x − 6 = 2x + 9.\n",
    "   - `5x - 2x = 9 + 6 ==> 3x = 15 ==> x = 15/3`\n",
    "   - `So, x = 5`\n",
    "9. A box contains red and blue marbles. If the ratio of red to blue marbles is 3:4 and there are 12 red marbles, how many blue marbles are there?\n",
    "    - `The above statement can be solved by proportion method 3/4 = 12/x`\n",
    "    - `By cross multiplication ==> 3x = 48 ==> x = 48/3 = 16`\n",
    "    - `16 blue marbles will be there to complete the ratio of 3:4`\n",
    "10. If the price of a jacket after tax is $108 and the tax rate is 8%, what is the original price of the jacket before tax?\n",
    "    -  `Suppose original cost of jacket is 'P'`\n",
    "    -  `Price after tax = original cost + 8% of original cost = P + 8% of P`\n",
    "    -  `108 = P + 0.08P ==> 108 = 1.08C ==> C = 108/1.08 = 100`\n",
    "    -  `So, the original price of jacket is $100`\n",
    "11. Convert a speed of 60 miles per hour to feet per second.\n",
    "    - `we know that 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet, and 1 hour is equal to 3600 seconds.`\n",
    "    - `60 miles per hour * (5280 feet per mile) / (3600 seconds per hour) = (60 * 5280)/3600 = 88`\n",
    "    - `So, a speed of 60 miles per hour is equivalent to 88 feet per second.`\n",
    "12. How many different outfits can you make with 4 shirts and 3 pairs of pants?\n",
    "    - `Total outfits = Number of shirts * Number of pants = 3 * 4 = 12`\n",
    "    - `So, we can make 12 outfits`\n",
    "13. Calculate the surface area of a cylinder with a radius of 3 units and a height of 5 units.\n",
    "    - `The area of surface (A) = (2 * π * r * h) + (2 * π * r^2) Here we have r=3 and h=5`\n",
    "    - `A = (2 * 3.14 * 3 *5) + (2 * 3.14 * 3^2) = 94.2 + 56.52 = 150.72`\n",
    "    - `So, the surface area of the cylinder 150.72 square units.`\n",
    "14. A bookstore offers a 15% discount on a book that originally costs $35. What is the discount amount?\n",
    "    - `Discounted amount = Original cost of book * 15% discount = (35 * 15)/100 = 525/100 = 5.25`\n",
    "    - `So, the discounted amount is $5.25`\n",
    "15. If you have a square plot of land with an area of 49 square meters, what is the perimeter of the plot?\n",
    "    - `We know that the perimeter of square (P) = 4 √Area of square Here '√' the root of square`\n",
    "    - `P = 4 √49 = 4 * 7 = 28`\n",
    "    - `So, we can say the perimeter of plot is 28 square units`"
